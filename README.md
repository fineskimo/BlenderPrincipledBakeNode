# BlenderPrincipledBakeNode
Principled BSDF node tree that has a global switch to export textures to common PBR channels.

## tl;dr
* _I found out that the tool/node might not be for everyone. This is also why I hesitated with a release._
* _This work is heavily based around the workflow to bake procedrual textures to bitmaps as provided by [Aidy Burrows](https://twitter.com/AidyBurrows3D "@aidyburrows's twitter") and [Gleb Alexandrov](https://twitter.com/gleb_alexandrov "@gleb_alexandrov's twitter") here: [Using Blender Like Substance Designer](https://www.creativeshrimp.com/blender-substance-designer.html)._
* _This is inteded to be used with blender 2.8x which is still in development. Things may break.
* This thing comes __without any warranty__. Best practice is to use this on a copy on your current project first.
